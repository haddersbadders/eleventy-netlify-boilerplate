You can embed media from lots of places like Kaltura, YouTube, Twitter, and more into your Blackboard content.

It's really easy and it will work or any service that offers users an **embed** option.

To do this, all you need to do is:

1. find an **embed code**
2. copy the embed code
3. paste the embed code **as HTML** to your Blackboard content

## Finding the Embed Code

The trickiest part is finding the embed code in the firs place, but her are a few examples:

#### In Kaltura

**Note**: If you want to insert **your own** video content into Blackboard from Kaltura, you don't need to do it like this. You can use the Mashups Tool from within Blackboard.

If you want to embed someone else's Kaltura video into Blackboard:

Open the video page and find the **share tab**:

Then from the share tab, find the **embed tab**:

Then on the embed tab, **check the size** of the video you want to embed (large is recommended) and **copy the embed code**:

#### In **YouTube**

You can find the embed code under **share** below the video's low-bar:

This brings up various options. Choose **Embed**:

This then gives you to the embed code. Just copy this:

## Paste the embed code

Once you've copied an embed code, you just need to paste it. But in a specific way:

Create a new item in Blackboard by hovering over the **Build Content** menu and choosing **Item**:

Next, find the **Source Code** button **< >** in the text editor, you may need to toggle the show more button if you can't see it:

Paste in your embed code and press update:

This will give you a preview of your media in the editor:

Save this and you'll see the video is now embedded!
